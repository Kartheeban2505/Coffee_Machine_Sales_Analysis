# Coffee Machine Sales Analysis

# Project Overview
This project focuses on building an interactive dashboard for a coffee vending machine business. It aims to analyze sales data across multiple dimensions, providing actionable insights into product performance,
payment methods, and customer preferences. The dashboard was developed using Power BI with calculated metrics created through DAX.

# Problem Statement
The business lacked a centralized and interactive way to monitor coffee machine sales, analyze trends, and identify top-performing products and payment methods. This limited the ability to make data-driven decisions
and understand customer buying behavior effectively.This project leverages SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization to provide actionable insights, with the ultimate goal of enabling a projected 
sales growth in the upcoming month.

# Task List
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Ensured the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.
Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
2. **Data Modeling in Power BI:** Defined relationships between tables. Created calculated columns and measures using DAX (e.g., Total Revenue, Sales Quantity).
3. **Dashboard Development:** Designed an interactive layout with slicers for Month and Day.
Developed visualizations like bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
Incorporated KPIs for Total Revenue, Total Sales Quantity, and Top Product.
4. **DAX Calculations:** Created measures for total revenue, sales by product, and trends over time.
Calculated percentage contribution of payment methods (cash vs card).
5. **Testing and Validation:** Validated data accuracy for visualizations.
Ensured slicers worked correctly for filtering.
