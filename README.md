# Coffee Machine Sales Analysis

# Project Overview
This project focuses on building an interactive dashboard for a coffee vending machine business. It aims to analyze sales data across multiple dimensions, providing actionable insights into product performance,
payment methods, and customer preferences. The dashboard was developed using Power BI with calculated metrics created through DAX.

# Problem Statement
The business lacked a centralized and interactive way to monitor coffee machine sales, analyze trends, and identify top-performing products and payment methods. This limited the ability to make data-driven decisions
and understand customer buying behavior effectively.This project leverages SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization to provide actionable insights, with the ultimate goal of enabling a projected 
sales growth in the upcoming month.
